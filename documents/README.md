# SoundFirst PRO - Controller
![SoundFirst PRO Logo](logo.png)

**The "Sound-First" Evolution.**

### Born from Necessity
This project was born from a real need. Its creator, a blind producer with limited economic resources to access expensive accessibility hardware, decided not to surrender to barriers. Instead, he created his own workflow to level the playing field.

Today, this tool is shared freely with the world, in the hope that it empowers others facing similar challenges, or simply helps any producer seeking a deeper, distraction-free connection with their music.

> *"When you remove visual distraction, all that remains is the truth of the audio."*

### Why Your Studio Needs This

*   **Real Analog Feel (10-Bit):** Forget standard MIDI stepping (0-127). We have unlocked the encoders' native resolution (0-1023) so you feel every nuance of your filters and compression.
*   **Auto-Solo Technology:** The system "knows" what you are touching. Rest your finger on an EQ knob, and we isolate that frequency instantly. Lift your finger, and you are back in the mix. No clicks, no menus.
*   **Native HID Speed:** Direct communication with the Reaper core via C++. Zero latency. Total reliability.
*   **Smart Banking:** The controller tracks your selection in Reaper and automatically assigns faders. You will never get lost in banks of 8 tracks again.
*   **Easy Mapping:** Map any plugin in seconds using our intuitive **SoundFirst PRO Mapper**. No coding required.
